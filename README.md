# open kirkes
OpenKirkes is a project aimed to offer open APIs to Kirkes for everyone who wants it (that includes libraries in Tuusula, Järvenpää, Kerava and Mäntsälä). For that this backend is providing "proxy", which makes it easy to use Kirkes' basic functionality as a REST API



## Why is this existing in the first place?
Because almost every library (when requesting APIs) looks at you and says "We don't give you any APIs, go and die", but when a company enters the stage, they go and hug them. That's why, because of sh*t libraries' IT sysadmins

## How does it work?
By parsing HTML, and some JSON (AJAX calls)
